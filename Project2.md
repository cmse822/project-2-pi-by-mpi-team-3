## 3.1 Solution

Done!

## 3.2 Solution 

Done!

## 3.3 Solution

Every processors loads and runs the binary. Therefore even without including MPI library we get 4 exections of the code. 

## 3.4 Solution

We see 12 total "Hello, World!" (when we feed in 4 ranks). The "Hello, World" before and after the MPI rin in serial on every processor so should each be output 4 times fora total of 8. And since we do not limit the output for the one in the middle it should also be output 4 times, for a total of 12.
